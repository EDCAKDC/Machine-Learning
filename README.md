# 🔍 Binary Classification Models with Randomized Search

👋 Hi there! I'm a beginner in machine learning, and this is a personal project where I explore various **binary classification models**.

 At first, I used **grid search** to tune hyperparameters, but I quickly realized it's too slow when the parameter space grows.  
 So, to save time and speed things up, I switched to **RandomizedSearchCV** for hyperparameter optimization. It’s much faster and still performs well!

📦 Models included in this repo:
- 🌳 Decision Tree
- 🌲 Random Forest
- 🚀 XGBoost
- 💡 LightGBM
- 📐 Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- 🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

✅ Each model is evaluated using **AUC on a validation set**, and the best models are saved for reuse.

## 🔮 Future Plans
-  Model interpretability (e.g. SHAP, permutation importance)
-  Survival models (e.g. Cox, RSF)
-  Try AutoML tools
-  Visualization and report generation
